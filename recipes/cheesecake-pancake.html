    <li>3/4 cup strawberry jam</li>
    <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons white sugar (divided)</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons milk</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>

    <li>Graham cracker crumbs or powdered sugar for topping</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>For the topping, combine strawberries and jam in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer; set aside.</li>
        <li>For the cream cheese swirl, combine cream cheese, 3 tablespoons sugar, milk, and vanilla in a small bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth.</li>
        <li>Transfer cream cheese mixture to a pastry bag or a resealable plastic bag with a corner snipped off.</li>
        <li>For the pancake batter, combine flour, remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine egg, buttermilk, and oil in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Add egg mixture all at once to the flour mixture. Stir just until moistened (batter should be slightly lumpy).</li>
        <li>Heat an extra-large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/3 cup portions of batter onto the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
        <li>Cook until bottoms are golden brown and edges are slightly dry, and bubbles form at the edges of the pancakes, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pipe a swirl of cream cheese onto each pancake starting from the center.</li>
        <li>Coat the uncooked side of the pancakes with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Turn and cook 2 to 3 minutes more on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter and cream cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Serve with strawberry topping and sprinkle with graham cracker crumbs or dust with powdered sugar.</li>
