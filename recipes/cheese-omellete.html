<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed</li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1/4 cup shredded Emmentaler cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper. Whisk until the egg mixture is foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in the egg mixture and swirl the skillet so the bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook until the egg starts to set, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg can flow towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.</li>
    <li>Carefully flip the omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese down the middle of the omelette; fold in half. Cook until the cheese is melted, about 20 seconds.</li>
    <li>Slide the omelette onto a plate.</li>
